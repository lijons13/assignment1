        <li>when you don't create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. your tastes only narrow & exclude people. so create</li>
        <li>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute</li>
        <li>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live</li>
        <li>Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning</li>
        <li>Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand</li>
